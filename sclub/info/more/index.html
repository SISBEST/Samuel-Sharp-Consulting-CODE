<h2>Characters</h2>
<a href="javascript:alert('Characters are imaginary characters that you must create or derive from a visual. In the latter, the visual is simply an appearance and you create the actual character. However, it is hard for the character to be a character. Your spirit character is the only character you can fuse with. What is a spirit character? It has your personalities but may or may not have your life. She/he is half you, the rest is her/his-story (geddit!?) You may also use a song as a story for your character. Your character needs to have some sort of story, whether a comic, backstory, or 12,000 page trilogy. Your character is also NOT your character. They will exist in your head and you can limit them, and they of course do not exist (in THIS universe, that is), but bear in mind that characters have minds. 
You can also send forth a heroine or hero to be your guide, whether they be alive or past. In the case of past, Tartarus-level players can make it, roll dice for their actions, and go inside the head of the character for a long time before realizing just what they’d do. You can’t control these characters, even if they’re your friends.');>Learn More</a>
